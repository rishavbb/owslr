# OW-SLR: Overlapping Windows on Semi-Local Region for Image Super-Resolution
### [Project Page](https://rishavbb.github.io/ow-slr/index.html) | [Paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2313-433X/9/11/246) | [Data](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/octa-500)

This is the official implementation for [OW-SLR: Overlapping Windows on Semi-Local Region for Image Super-Resolution](https://www.mdpi.com/2313-433X/9/11/246). OW-SLR provides better results for classifying healthy and diseased retinal images such as diabetic retinopathy and normals from the given set of OCT-A images.

### Training

```
python3 train.py --config train.yaml
```

### Testing

```
python3 test.py --config train.yaml --batch_size 40000 --img_path 438.png --upscale_factor 4.5 --model_path save/train/epoch-last.pth
```

Considering reducing the batch size if you run out of GPU memory.
